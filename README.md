### Project Intro/Objective

The main purpose of this project is to build a sustainable system-wide business-model with predictive analytics to solve a universal human resources problem: employee attrition and retention. The overarching goal is adoption by any given human resource department – identifying and pre-emptively targeting pitfalls/ gaps in employee trajectories to reduce attrition.

An undisclosed multinational corporation (MNC) has provided an Excel (.xlsx) file for academic research in people analytics. However, the use-case can extend to practical human resources problem-solving methods.

People analytics traditionally benefits from “using statistical insights from employee data to make talent management decisions” (Leonardi & Contractor, 2018). Gathering historical information on employees’ performance, promotional patterns, and length of time served are valuable tools that do not establish trajectories that can be useful in a decision-making framework. Data in and of itself is not inherently valuable unless it yields high quality information that, in turn, yields actionable insights. For example, “Tata Consultancy Services found that just 5% of big-data investments go to HR, the group that typically manages people analytics… only 9% of companies believe they have a good understanding of which talent dimensions drive performance in their organizations” (Leonardi & Contractor, 2018). Employee attrition costs the company time, money, and resources. The company “bleeds” money when retention is not optimum. Thus, investing money into something that is not used or useful drains the company’s bottom line. To this end, we will provide tools and technologies to resolve retention for this MNC.

### Project Description

Kaggle is the source of the dataset with the 11 following features. The first three are 'employee id', 'satisfaction_level', and 'last_evaluation.' 'Number_project', 'average_monthly_hours', and 'time_spend_company' follow. The remaining predictors are 'work_accident', 'promotion_last_5years', 'department', and 'salary'. The target (outcome) variable is 'left' – used to predict employee retention. The dataset consists of 14,999 rows (observations).
